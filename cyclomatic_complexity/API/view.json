        "header": "Prepares a statistic result to be represented by a most convenient way as flamegraph and should not be a matter of intermediate interest. Although the query seems not a quite usable, it reveils the most valueable parameters to set:\n\n`-attr mmcc,tmcc,sif,lif`\n\n Using these parameters, you can determine which data would be generated on a flamegraph picture using `flamegraph` API.\n\nThe default values assumes that all metrics would be presented on top of a flamegraph stack. Having all attributes turned on, the final picture, likely, would appear as very noisefull schema and not much usefull for analysis. Please narrow the attributes list to collect a more representable plot. Typically, only one value as `-attr mmcc` or `-attr lif` is more than enough",
        "body": "To make a query:\n\n`echo \"0\" > api.pmccabe_collector.restapi.org/cc/statistic/view/GET/exec`\n\nTo wait and extract the query result:\n\n`cat api.pmccabe_collector.restapi.org/cc/statistic/view/GET/result.txt > <your_filename>.txt`\n\n",
